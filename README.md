# ShootEmUpDemo
Game Demostration of a Shoot 'Em Up! by Izhan Gallardo

This simple demo was made to explore Object Pooling and Object Instantiation in Unity, combining the ramdomness and the progressive difficulty increase of the Clicker Demo and the parallaxing and object instantiation of the Infinity Runner Demo I made.
